Initial Sizing contains tools used for initial sizing of tiltrotor. STOL Initial Sizing contains tools used for initial sizing of STOL aircraft. Detailed sizing contains sizing code updated with drag prediction and final aircraft configuration. Performance contains performance calculation tools. ElectricJustification.m produces energy density requirements for given L/D and range requirements. EmptyWeightSizing.m was used to generate tiltoror empty weight estimating relationship. PreLim_Tiltrotor_ConstraintDiagram.m was used to generate the tiltoror constraint diagrams at various performance regimes.
